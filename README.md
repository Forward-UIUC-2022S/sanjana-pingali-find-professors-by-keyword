# find-professors-by-keyword
Algorithmic Design
-----------------------------
The goal of this module is to use the match scores between paper-keyword assignments to rank professors. This is done by obtaining an input of keywords and using the provided scores between keywords and papers to find the total scores of papers given these keywords and in turn using these papers to find the total score of professors.
